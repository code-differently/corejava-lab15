# Return Ready Lab 15

* Part A - Foundations 6.2
* Part B - Foundations 6.3
* Part C - Instructor Challenge

## Part A

### Example and Activity 01

#### Step 01

In the package `lab15.part_a.examples` look at the file `Example01_WhileLoopExample` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.lab15.part_a.activity` complete the `Activity01_WhileLoopExample` class so that it accepts an input called stop, and counts from 0 to the value of stop.

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output.

> Use Example01_WhileLoopExample for reference.

```
Please enter a number to count to: 
8
The Current Number is :0
The Current Number is :1
The Current Number is :2
The Current Number is :3
The Current Number is :4
The Current Number is :5
The Current Number is :6
The Current Number is :7
We are done
```

### Example and Activity 02

#### Step 01

In the package `lab15.part_a.examples` look at the file `Example02_WhileLoopExample2` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.lab15.part_a.activity` complete the `Activity02_WhileLoopExample2` class so that it accepts an input called value, performs the arithmetic and saves it to sum, as long as the input number is NOT 0.
If the input is 0, the program should print out the Sum of the integers and exit. 

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output.

> Use Example02_WhileLoopExample2 for reference.

```
Enter first integer (enter 0 to quit): 2
Enter next integer (enter 0 to quit): 3
Enter next integer (enter 0 to quit): 5
Enter next integer (enter 0 to quit): 0
Sum of the integers: 10
Terminating the program.
```

### Example and Activity 03

#### Step 01

In the package `lab15.part_a.examples` look at the file `Example03_DoWhileLoopExample` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.lab15.part_a.activity` complete the `Activity03_DoWhileLoopExample` class so that you print out only the EVEN numbers from 0 to 20.

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output.

> Use Example03_DoWhileLoopExample for reference.

```
 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19
```

## Part B

### Example and Activity 01

#### Step 01

In the package `lab15.part_b.examples` look at the file `Example01_LoopWithBreak` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.lab15.part_b.activity` complete the `Activity01_LoopWithBreak` class so that it accepts positive numbers from a user, sums them, and returns them. 
Use a break statement to check if the user enters a negative number, if so, ensure that the program terminates. 

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output.

> Use Example01_LoopWithBreak for reference.

```
Enter a number: 4.5
Enter a number: 3.5
Enter a number: 2
Enter a number: -3
Sum = 10.0
```

### Example and Activity 02

#### Step 01

In the package `lab15.part_b.examples` look at the file `Example01_LoopWithContinue` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.lab15.part_b.activity` complete the `Activity01_LoopWithContinue` class so that you loop through and print 0 through 10.
If the number is between 4 and 9, ensure that the program continues by using the continue keyword. 

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output.

> Use Example01_LoopWithContinue for reference.

```
1
2
3
4
9
10
```
